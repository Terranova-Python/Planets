# Planets
Pick a planet, then the GUI will do the rest!

You will need to install Tkinter and Pillow for it to work

Make sure plant png's are in the root, or you will need to change the DIR for them to pull
I ran into an issue where I had to pack item4.pack() to get the picture to upload to canvas2
If anyone has a way around this please let me know, it throws an error but if you get rid of it, the picture doesn't update... Strange...

Thanks!
